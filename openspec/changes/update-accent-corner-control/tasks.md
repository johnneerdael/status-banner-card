## 1. Implementation

- [ ] 1.1 Update config schema/types to use `accent_corner` (drop start/end).
- [ ] 1.2 Adjust editor UI to a single corner selector; keep width/height sliders, hide/full toggles.
- [ ] 1.3 Update accent rendering to anchor at `accent_corner` with width/height along adjacent edges; full-background disables clip-path.
- [ ] 1.4 Add/adjust tests for corner positions, hide, and full-background behavior.
- [ ] 1.5 Update docs/help text to reflect single corner control and sizing behavior.

## 2. Validation

- [ ] 2.1 Run lint/tests after changes.
- [ ] 2.2 Confirm editor saves/loads `accent_corner` and rendering matches selections.
